            <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify text-lg leading-7 mb-3 font-sans">I'm Irene, a web developer in the early stages of my career. Earlier this year, I completed an intensive web development bootcamp, where I immersed myself in a practical learning environment that allowed me to acquire and apply key skills from day one.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify text-lg leading-7 mb-3 font-sans"> During the bootcamp, I worked on multiple practical projects covering both front-end and back-end, using a variety of technologies. On the front-end, I specialized in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and TypeScript. On the back-end, I gained experience with Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB, developing robust and efficient applications. Additionally, I have developed skills in testing, using tools like Mocha to ensure code quality and reliability.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify text-lg leading-7 mb-3 font-sans">Throughout this time, I have been working on personal projects to consolidate my knowledge, while learning new technologies like PHP, MySQL, and Laravel. Currently, I have the opportunity to participate in a collaborative project with an experienced team in the industry, serving as a Junior Developer. This experience allows me to learn from experienced professionals and actively contribute to the project's development.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify text-lg leading-7 mb-3 font-sans">My main motivation is to solve problems and create solutions that improve people's lives. I am passionate about continuous learning and always seek new opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify text-lg leading-7 mb-3 font-sans">I am excited about the opportunities that the future holds for me and am looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to continue growing professionally and contribute with my knowledge. If you have a project in mind or simply want to know more about my work, feel free to contact me!</p>
